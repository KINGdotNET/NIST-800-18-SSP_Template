   General Support System
      An interconnected set of information resources under the same direct
      management control that shares common functionality. It normally includes
      hardware, software, information, data, applications, communications, and
      people.

   ISA
   Interconnection Security Agreement
      An agreement established between the organizations that own and operate
      connected IT systems to document the technical requirements of the
      interconnection.  The ISA also supports a :term:`Memorandum of
      Understanding` or :term:`Memorandum of Agreement` (MOU/A) between the
      organizations.

   Major Application
   Major Applications
      An application that requires special attention to security due to the
      risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or
      unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the
      application. Note: All federal applications require some level of
      protection. Certain applications, because of the information in them,
      however, require special management oversight and should be treated as
      major. Adequate security for other applications should be provided by
      security of the systems in which they operate.

   MOA
   MOU
   Memorandum of Agreement
   Memorandum of Understanding
      A document established between two or more parties to define their
      respective responsibilities in accomplishing a particular goal or
      mission.  An MOU/A defines the responsibilities of two or more
      organizations in establishing, operating, and securing a system
      interconnection.

   Minor Application
   Minor Applications
      An application, other than a :term:`major application`, that requires
      attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting
      from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the
      information in the application. Minor applications are typically included
      as part of a :term:`general support system`.
